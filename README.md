**IMPORTANT:** This API specification is a work in progress, so until there is an official release, please bear in mind that this spec might change and that we know this is far from perfect. Having said that, the DNB Developer team would love to hear your thoughts on it (after all, that's why we are publishing it). So feel free to reach out at developer@dnb.no or submit a pull request right here!
